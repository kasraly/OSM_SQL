    "# OpenStreetMap Data Case Study\n",
    "## Map Area\n",
    "I have chosen the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I have recently moved to Edmonton and believe this project will help me to know the city better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The city area in openstreetmap.org: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2564500  \n",
    "Downloaded the OSM XML file from: https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/edmonton_canada/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems encountered in the map\n",
    "### Street names\n",
    "After initial audit of the street names two main inconsistencies were encountered:\n",
    "- Abbreviated street types: `St` versus `Street`\n",
    "- Multiple spaces between words: `207 Street   North-west` having 3 spaces between `Street` and `North-west`\n",
    "\n",
    "### House number\n",
    "The audit on housenumber revealed that:\n",
    "- The house number is often part of the street name: `26323 Township Road 532A` where `26323` is the house number. This mostly happens for rural areas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Postal code\n",
    "The postal code in Canada is in the form of `A1A 1A1` and usally written in capitals letters.  \n",
    "Often in the data base the postal codes are written in lower letters or the two parts are attached. \n",
    "\n",
    "### City, Province, Country\n",
    "For `way` tags often city, province, and country infromation was combined in `is_in` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixing the issues\n",
    "When auditing and fixing the street names the following rules where followed. \n",
    "-\tIf the last word is a direction word (east, north, etc.) the second last word will also be audited \n",
    "-\tIf the last word is a number (e.g. `Township Road 532A`) the second last word will be audited\n",
    "-\tIf the last word is a number, and the first word is also a number, then the first word would be considered as the house number\n",
    "-\tThe spacing between words will be reduced to 1 space\n",
    "\n",
    "The postal code was updated to match the standard. i.e. used capital letters and one space between the first three and second three characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The province and country names, when present, were replaced with Alberta and Canada, respectively. If the information was in `is_in` tag, it was changed to appropriate city, province and country tags. "

    "It would be a good idea to include a percentage number showing the accuracy of the information in that 'node' or 'way'. This has two benefits. First, anyone who is developing applications based on the OSM data can decide which information they want to trust and which information they want to skip. Second, people who want to contribute to the database can identify which infroamtion is not accurate and requires review.\n",

    "Ideally, this process would be automated. Similar to the way the Street types were audited, various tags can be audited and based on the number of incostencies found, a confidence number will be given to each node or way.  \n",
    "Of course, this process requires the data be compared to a separate database. In the case of street type, the data base was basically a python list that identifies the valid street types.\n",
    "I belielve it is possible to query the data against google maps database or foursquare database and see how accurate is a specific node or way \n",
    "\n",
    "### Anonymous GPS data collection for automated extraction of map features\n",
    "Another idea to improve and automate the process of improving map features is to collect anonymous data from OSM users, possilibly through free mobile applications that utilize OSM data.  \n",
    "When enough GPS data is avialabe for a street, that data can be used to identify the speed limit, direction of street, school zones and its hours, on-street parking limitations, etc. These information seems to be missing from OSM and would significantly improve its use in mobile navigation.\n"
